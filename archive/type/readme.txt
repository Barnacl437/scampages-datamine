NOTE BEFORE PROGRESSING FURTHER:
This "type" folder is for separating different kinds of scamming, classified by service domain names.

If you are contributing to this, you can add a folder with service domain name if it's not done so already, 
such as "discord.com/" or "steamcommunity.com/" and then create your folders with the corresponding scam 
domain names inside, for example "steencumgoonity.com/" (cum grano salis). Complying to this will ensure 
this repo be properly managed and will make it more useful for people looking around.
