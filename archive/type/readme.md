### NOTE BEFORE PROGRESSING FURTHER:
This "type" folder is for separating different kinds of scamming, classified by service domain names.

If you are contributing to this, you can add a folder with service domain name if it's not done so already, such as `discord.com/` or `steamcommunity.com/` and then make a record of those scam websites by creating your folders with the corresponding scam domain names inside, for example `steencumgoonity.com/` (cum grano salis). 

You can also make subfolders for different file types inside the folders for each record, such as js/ or html/. Upload it directly or you can fork and make pull requests to this repo. Complying to this will ensure this repo be properly managed and will make it more useful for people looking around. 

### Naming convention:
You should sort different kinds of data into their own folders named with their file types, like this:

For subfolder levelling preserved from those websites, add a _ (dash) to the end of folder name (such as `terny_`).
