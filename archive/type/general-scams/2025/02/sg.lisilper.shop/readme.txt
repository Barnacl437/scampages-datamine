other info:

general type scam page. at the root of the page it disguises itself as an age check/age verification, somewhere inside the folder there may be several scam pages that replicate a Vietnamese telecom corporation's unreal reward winning, saying that the user might have won an iPhone or similar products. probably a result of ambiguous-click redirecting.

flags: age check, general scam, telecom
