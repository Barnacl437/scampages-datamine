# scampages-datamine
my early effort on scraping and archiving scam, fake or disguising websites, especially those regarding attempts to scam via discord or steam $50 gift thingy lel

### What'll be inside
I plan to scrape pretty anything I could put into, maybe a zip packing the whole website content, extracting shady js files from sus requests, or pretty much more things, neatly organised to each properly-named folders. For more, please look around at the repo.

### How efforts are done
For now I can always make all works done myself in this repo. The method I use to collect websites' datas is fairly simple: just open up your browser's devtool (F12 or Ctrl-Shift-I), navigate to network, refresh the page and select filter by filetype, like this, for example, it is filtered to show only css files:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e089a556-3d63-4a58-9e59-123f98f673c7)

Then right click an item and there are some save to file options. You can choose to save to a single file using the option `Save response as`. 


### ...anything else?
There are various scam shits around on the interwebz. I am still trying to detect and scraping their contents thru many sources, commonly via discord chats or steam pm where some jerks asked me to vote for their team on match.tf lol. You can notice suspicious links to such websites by seeing the root url be messed up to disguise the real thing. Open it in incognito/private mode or any browsers you don't use on productivity work machines for extra safety.

I also have an Internet Archive account where I save what I've found. I've been saving since at least 2021, so how much I've done on here will also have stuff on IArchive taken part in. If you're catching some curiousity right now, you can view my web archive [here](https://archive.org/details/@barnacle555/web-archive).
